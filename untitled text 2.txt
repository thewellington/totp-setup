We are employing additional security for shell access to all production linux systems.  We have selected a mixture of Time-based One Time Passwords and Public Key Authentication 

Time-based One Time Passwords (TOTP) essentially provides two factor authentication to a system.  In order to authenticate against the system you will be required to provide something you know (username and password) as well as something that you have.  We are using TOTP software tokens to meet the "something you have" requirement.  You will be asked for a TOTP token any time you log into the shell of a system for which you do not have a Public Key (see below) installed, and anytime you attempt to use the sudo command to elevate your privileges.  You will need to download a TOTP generator for your phone or your computer.  Here are some recommended applications for mobile devices:

	Android:  Google Authenticator, Authasas OATH TOTP Token
	iOS: Google Authenticator, Authasas OATH TOTP Token, HDE OTP Generator
	
After installing the TOTP generator, you will need to get a key from IT for each of the systems you will need access to.

Public Key Authentication is the second method of system security we will be using on our production linux systems.  This is a cryptographic key that you will generate on your computer.  You will then present this key whenever you attempt to SSH or SFTP into a production linux system.  If you have generated a key, and registered that key on the system you are trying to access, you will be granted access to the system from your computer without the need to provide a password, or a TOTP token.  You will still be required to present a TOTP token whenever you attempt to use sudo to elevate your privileges.
